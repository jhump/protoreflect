// Package protoprint provides a mechanism to generate protobuf source code
// from descriptors.
//
// This can be useful to turn file descriptor sets (produced by a compiler like
// protoc or buf) back into proto IDL code. Combined with the
// [github.com/jhump/protoreflect/v2/protobuilder] package, it can also be used
// to perform code generation of proto source code.
